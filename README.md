# SoMa App
React Native Application built on Expo that connects sellers/buyers and keeps parties safe with integrated [SafeTrek API](https://docs.safetrek.io/reference#authentication) to ensure parties are safe during transactions.
The transaction phase contains a SafeTrek-esque button. 

# Integrated:
*SafeTrek Buttons
*Post (Title, Description, Address, Price, Image, Camera, Map)
Show Interest Button

# Future Integration:
*Replace map and use Yelp API to let users choose safe areas as meeting places (coffee shop, mall, etc.) 
*Profiles w/ star ratings for user OR keep anonymity
